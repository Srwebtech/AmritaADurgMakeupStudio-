                <h1>Bridal HD Makeup</h1>
                <img src="../gallery/8.jpg" alt="Bridal HD Makeup">
                <p>HD makeup eliminates skin imperfections without making your face look blurry when compared to a standard finish. HD makeup is what most celebrities and international professional makeup artists swear by as it gives a very natural, non-cakey, soft and flawless look. HD makeup looks sheer while hiding flaws such as uneven texture, blemishes, pores, and scars. On your wedding day, you will be moving around constantly and getting your pictures taken. You don’t want a finish that’ll make your skin’s imperfections stand out with the camera’s flash, and you need something that’ll last throughout the function. HD makeup is the most common type of makeup, especially in the form of foundation and loose powder. The final finish is soft and natural rather than heavy.</p>

                <h1>Bridal Airbrush Makeup</h1>
                <img src="../gallery/3.jpg" alt="Bridal Airbrush Makeup">
                <p>This is for the bride who wants to look and feel like herself but enhance her natural features. It can bring out the best you on your special day. It uses the effects of light and dark to create a pleasing look. This makeup is meant to enhance the wearer’s features without being loud. This look is achieved with minimal face powders along with illuminating, dewy-finish foundations and a minimum amount of highlighters. It can hide skin imperfections effectively, giving a smooth and comfortable finish. The glowing, nude looks perfectly enhance your features without adding too much color to your visage for that ‘no makeup’ feel and goes perfectly with any attire or event.</p>

                <h1>Simple Makeup</h1>
                <img src="../gallery/5.jpg" alt="Simple Makeup">
                <p>This makeup tends to lend a natural glow or illumination because of the natural mineral ores. It doesn’t contain any dyes or synthetic substances. This is perfect for sensitive skin that tends to break out easily. This makeup is highly pigmented, long-lasting for acne-prone and mature skin. It is significantly safer and contains SPF, which is perfect for outdoor shoots.</p>
